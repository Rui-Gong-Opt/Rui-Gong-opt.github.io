I am a second year master student in Uwaterloo Combinatorics and Optimization Department advised by [Professor Levent Tuncel](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~ltuncel/).
My research interests lie in the areas of mathematical programming and optimization. I am particularly interested in analyzing and developing algorithms for semidefinite optimization problems.

Before becoming a master student, I graduated from Uwaterloo with a BMath in Mathematical Optimization, Statistics and Mathematical Finance.

Here is my [CV](https://github.com/Rui-Gong-Opt/Rui-Gong-opt.github.io/tree/master/files/cv.pdf)
